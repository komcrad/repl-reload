# repl-cud

Reloads changed namespaces automatically.

## Usage

I like to us `.lein/profiles.clj` for this  

```
{:user {:dependencies [[repl-cud "0.1.0"]]
        :repl-options
        {:init (do (require 'clojure.tools.namespace.repl 'repl-cud.core)
                   (clojure.tools.namespace.repl/refresh)
                   (repl-cud.core/auto-reload)
                   (use 'clojure.repl))}}}
```
